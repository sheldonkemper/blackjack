{"name":"Blackjack","tagline":"Open University collaborative project","body":"### Welcome to the Open University M250 collaborative project.\r\nThe aim of the project, is to cement some of the concepts taught in the Java M250 module. We are using a combination of tools to manage this project. Join our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1665607883687799/) to stay up to date of all progress with this project.\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram\r\n<script src=\"https://www.gliffy.com/diagramEmbed.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">gliffy_did=\"10058585\";embedGliffy();</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
