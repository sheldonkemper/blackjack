##Version 1
House asks how many Players, players selected. Cards are dealt by Dealer, player 1s cards show, Dealer asks to hit or stick, Player is handed card if they type h or hit which shows up via command line. 
if they type s or stick or they go over 21, next player's cards are show and hit or stick is asked.
Player closes to 21 is then designated the winner.

The deck will hold cards, this needs to be shuffled, the array list offers the shuffle function without the need to do this our selfs.
The card class only represents one card not a collection of card, the deck is made up of a collection of cards.
With a deck you add a card, remove a card and shuffle the deck.
 
The hand should be a separate class made up of cards dealt by the Dealer, each Player, plus your hand also needs to change as you want to hit or stick.
